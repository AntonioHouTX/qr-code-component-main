## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned the challenging aspect of responsive web design.  Web development sometimes is not necessarily a "one-size-fits-all" proposition.

### Continued development

I would still like to focus on centering the main element on a variety of screen widths, as well as improve my grasp of media queries to make my websites more responsive.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - As always, my go-to resource for anything HTML, CSS, or JavaScript-related.
